Pages:
- Landing page 
- Login/ signup page
- Dashboard
  - Users can access statistics and notifications here.
- Navigation bar to access other pages on the site.
- Settings page
    - Logout button
    - Communication settings
- FAQ/Help

Learnability:
- Tutorial demo (React Modal) pops up that shows a user which buttons to click to accomplish particular actions.  Demo will have a do not show again button.
The landing page that the main URL leads to will also have a short but detailed description to what exactly is to be accomplished by 
using the application. It will have information on the science of space repetition and its uses/practicality so that when they are presented with the dashboard,
they will have an understanding of what exactly is being accomplished when different leetcode patterns are toggled on and off.
Efficiency:
- Every task can be accomplished in two clicks using the dashboard.  The dashboard is displayed immediately upon login. 
    - Here's the thought process. Go to the URL to access the site, and this brings you to a landing page.
    Click once to login, enter login information, and upon clicking again for submission, you will find yourself on the dashboard,
    which will be capable of changing every setting necessary for altering and enhancing your learning experience. Here, the different
    leetcode patterns can be toggled on and off for learning with a simple click. If you want to access the help page, the landing page, alternate
    settings page, etc. There will be a navigation bar to immediately go to such pages with only one click.
Memorability:
- A tutorial button that can reinstate the tutorial for navigation. This tutorial will appear on how to use our site every time that the user
logs into the dashboard as a reminder on how to use the site. They can choose to disable it using the "Do not show" button when
they feel that they have memorized the sites usability, but can reinstate it if they want in settings if they feel they've forgotten.
 An FAQ page will exist with answers to simple tasks such that the user can clear up any confusion they have with the user interface, although
 we perceive it to be minimal.
